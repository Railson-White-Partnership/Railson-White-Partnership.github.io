<h1>Films and film licensing in care homes</h1>
<p>A joint venture between Warner Brothers and Sony Pictures, Filmbank represents the leading Hollywood and independent film studios in the area of film licensing and film usage in care homes. This is a complicated and contentious issue. Residents watching films in their own private room within a care or nursing home do not require a licence. However, when a film is viewed in a public area such as the communal lounge, a licence is required.</p>
<p><strong>The brief</strong><br />
Filmbank approached RWP to help counteract a hostile campaign in the sector trade press, backed by a petition on the government website, and explain the issue of film licensing to care home owners and managers.</p>
<p><strong>The solution</strong><br />
Where another main licensing organisation had conducted an aggressive campaign threatening care homes with prosecution if they did not have a licence, Filmbank and RWP opted for a strategy of constructive engagement. As part of this approach RWP produced a series of feature length articles for the trade press to inform and educate the care home sector. These features explained how Filmbank had simplified the licensing process and highlighted the value of films as part of a care home entertainment programme.</p>
<p><strong>The result</strong><br />
This policy of constructive support was welcomed by the main trade press publications which picked up and ran the features. The issue was defused and support for the government petition tailed off rapidly.</p>
