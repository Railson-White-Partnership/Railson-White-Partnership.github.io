<h1>White House Care Home: A video tour adds life to the website</h1>
<p>The White House, owned by Langton Care, is a comfortable residential care home for up to 18 elderly people in the attractive seaside town of Teignmouth, Devon.<br />
The website, designed and built by RWP, contains all the necessary factual information about the home, including its location and facilities. It also describes the high quality of personal care and attention that its residents can expect.</p>
<p><strong>The brief</strong><br />
The Client asked RWP to find a competitive edge; an approach that would make the home, as seen initially on the website, more attractive to people looking for long term care for an elderly relative, usually a parent. This is a time of extreme anxiety, so prospects need reassurance and guidance on what to look for.</p>
<p><strong>The solution</strong><br />
To achieve this, RWP proposed a video tour of the home which is now featured in a special link on the website. The format adopted was a series of specially shot, still photographs, underpinned by a sound track featuring an interview with the home’s owner and manager. The interview was conducted by one of RWP’s associates, a professional presenter on BBC regional radio.</p>
<p>By using some wonderful spontaneous shots of the care team interacting with the residents, the video captures the essential character of the home, creating a feeling of warmth and showing the genuine concern of the staff for the well-being of the residents.</p>
<p><strong>The result</strong><br />
The White House enjoys high occupancy levels, which the owner attributes in part to the way in which the website has helped to increase the number of initial enquiries.</p>
