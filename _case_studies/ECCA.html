<p>The English Community Care Association (ECCA) is the country&#8217;s leading representative body for care providers. Each year ECCA holds a major conference and exhibition targeting owners, senior directors and managers from individual care homes and care home groups across the country.</p>
<p><strong>The brief</strong></p>
<p>For four years running, RWP has been briefed to organise the conference at a major London venue and market the event to delegates and exhibitors.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The solution</strong></p>
<p>RWP deploys a highly visible, yet cost effective multi-media campaign spearheaded by advertising and PR in the sector trade press. Further support is given by tightly targeted e-marketing and website activity. Specially designed conference logos (see examples) which appear on all activity tie the different strands of the campaign together and enhance the promotional impact. RWP&#8217;s input includes design and production of the delegate brochure and signage for the event itself.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The result</strong></p>
<p>So far each conference has built on the success of the previous years. In 2010 we achieved a full house of over 250 delegates. Exhibitor numbers reached an all-time high and the event yielded a 10% increase in revenue for ECCA despite the difficult economic climate. It was also widely acclaimed by delegates and sponsors alike as the most successful sector conference of the year.</p>
