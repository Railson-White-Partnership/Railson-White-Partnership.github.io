<h1>ADR Care Home Group</h1>
<p>Care home marketing &amp; promotional support<o></o></p>
<p>The ADR Care Home Group consists of five residential care and nursing homes in <st1 w:st="on">East Anglia</st1> and <st1 w:st="on">North London</st1>. The homes provide personalised care for elderly people over 65 who may no longer be able to cope on their own. The guiding principle of the ADR Group is to treat each resident as an individual and encourage a full and active lifestyle in a comfortable, homely setting.<o></o></p>
<p><strong>The brief</strong><o></o></p>
<p>The homes are not large so high occupancy rates are important to ensure they remain profitable. In May 2008 RWP was appointed by the ADR Group to provide cost effective marketing and promotional support for the homes to help fill vacancies as they become available.<o></o></p>
<p><strong>The solution</strong><o></o></p>
<p>The quality of care provided is high and the homes are attractive and well appointed. These messages need regular reinforcement, so our strategy involves communication with the different target audiences to build awareness and put each home at the heart of its local community. This helps to ensure they are top of mind when specialist residential care is required.<o></o></p>
<p>RWP currently provides support at the following levels. Firstly by producing impactful, low cost press advertisements on a tactical basis to target respite and long stay residents as beds become available. Secondly, by sending out ad hoc press releases to cover, for example, details of major home improvements and service developments. And thirdly by working with the Client to develop and improve their website.<o></o></p>
<p><strong>The result</strong><o></o></p>
<p>These promotional activities have yielded visible results, with local press and magazine advertisements producing directly attributable enquiries and bookings. In the long term too the benefits will increase further as the homes obtain a higher profile within their local communities.<o></o></p>
